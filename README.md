# Night Engine
This is a game engine, that i am currently creating in java using the library [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/)

For this game engine to happen, i am following a tutorial from a youtube channel called: [GamesWithGabe](https://www.youtube.com/@GamesWithGabe)
It is an amazing tutorial series of creating a game engine from scratch to creating a 2d game inside of it.
